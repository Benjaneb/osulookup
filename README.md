# Osu!Lookup

This website allows you to quickly search up osu user's profiles to check their most important stats and also get a quick evaluation of the stats in the form of badges.

The website was made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) to enable an easy way to create a Single Page Application with reactive elements, styled using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for more feature-rich CSS and last but not least hosted by [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) for quick and easy deployment.
